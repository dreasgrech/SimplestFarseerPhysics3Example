Recently switched to version 3.x of [Farseer Physics Engine](http://farseerphysics.codeplex.com/) and have been experiencing slow simulations since?  Can't get anything to accelerate past a certain point because everything looks like it's floating in a damn aquarium?  Are you frustrated and tearing your hair out because you think this new version "sucks" !?  Don't worry, you're not alone!

This is the simplest Farseer Physics 3 example you can find which demonstrates how to leverage the [ConvertUnits](http://farseerphysics.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/85371#1642119) class from the samples to adapt to FPE's [MKS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKS_system_of_units) system of units.
